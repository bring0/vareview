I will say that years ago (when it was known as Westside VA), it was a dump. People selling drugs outside, roaming packs of people without appointments hanging around, etc.

In 2016, the improvements this VA has made are impressive. The doctors are knowledgable, nurses are friendly, and people are always willing to help. It&#039;s not like other hospitals I&#039;ve been to. The VA, and Jesse Brown in particular, is BUSY. Constantly. Easily 100+ people outside and in the lobby at 8 o&#039;clock in the morning. A lot of veterans don&#039;t just go to Jesse Brown to receive care, but use it as a community center. 

They may not be the most efficient organization in the country, but they do their best and have been sincerely and successfully making improvements.&lt;/div&gt;]]></description>

Appointments are cancelled without being rescheduled by the clinic. Lack of oversight in the Pharmacy. There is a pharmacy tech who will outright pretend to be the pharmacist to tell you why you cannot get your medications and lie about when/how you reordered them. Medication review information is poor to none. Physician Assistants are called Doctor. PAs often lack oversight as required by law-- a doctor is assigned but not present. The use of student doctors as first line reviewing and meeting with patients means that when they relay information, they are doing so without a full understanding of the issues of former military such as environmental exposure. The ER is always a 3-4 hour wait, regardless of how many veterans are in the waiting room. Even though there were open ER bays, I was left in a walkway for 3 hours waiting for a pregnancy test before they would treat men. I had a hysterectomy over 10 years prior. They never asked and claimed it was not in my records even though the Women&#039;s clinic was given that information. It is hard to understand the propensity of foreign-born doctors and nurses with heavy accents leading to incorrect medical information. There are clinics that discourage veterans from their services by manipulating wait times and appointment times, if you can even get a referral. They neglect to list diagnoses that have been proven and/or downplay the impact of a disease process on daily life.&lt;/div&gt;]]></description>

I have had several inpatient stays here and was well taken care of. The nurses were overworked but still kept a smile on their faces and were very nice. My care was above average.

I also have been kicked out of the ER on a holiday, but I was subsequently admitted at another hospital afterwards. This was very upsetting as the VA had previously admitted me for the same condition multiple times in the recent past. 

I have had to use Patient Advocacy twice to resolve some issues, but overall I can accept the care that Roudebush provides me.

The hospital itself is pretty modern and a recent increase in available parking has helped a lot! The staff have been mostly awesome, dedicated professionals, but you can tell that these folks put in a lot of hours!

I have not been to any other VAMC so I cannot compare, but Roudebush is more than acceptable for my current needs. I just wish the VA wouldn&#039;t force us vet&#039;s to refill meds via mail. I hate not knowing month to month if I&#039;m going to get my meds on time!!&lt;/div&gt;]]></description>

<div class="description">I use this clinic as my primary physician. They are ver nice, clean, and professional there. Wait times for routine appointments can be long 6-8 weeks. But the few times I needed to be seen quickly I was. For simple or routine doc appointments this is a good place to go.</div>
