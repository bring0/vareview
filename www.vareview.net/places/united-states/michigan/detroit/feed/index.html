				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since 1939, the Detroit VA Healthcare System has been improving the health of the men and women who have so proudly served our nation.  In 1996, the medical center moved from its original location in Allen Park, Michigan to the current location in Detroit. Located in the Midtown area of Detroit, it’s our privilege to serve your health care needs in any way we can. Services are available to more than 330,000 Veterans living in Wayne, Oakland, Macomb and St. Clair counties. This population represents approximately forty-four percent of the Veteran population in the lower peninsula of Michigan.</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>

<h2><a id="vision" class="bookmark" title="vision" name="vision"></a>Vision</h2>
<p>Our vision for the next decade is to be recognized as a leader in healthcare with a focus on meeting the unique healthcare needs of our surrounding community.
