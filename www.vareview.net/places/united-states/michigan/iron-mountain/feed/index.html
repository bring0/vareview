				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Oscar G. Johnson VA Medical Center (OGJVAMC) is located at Iron Mountain, MI, in Michigan&#8217;s Upper Peninsula.  The facility oversees six Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) located in Ironwood, Hancock, Marquette, Sault Ste. Marie, and Menominee, MI, and Rhinelander, WI.  It also operates a Rural Health Outreach Clinic in Manistique, MI.  OGJVAMC and its CBOCs /Rural Outreach Clinic annually serve 20,000 Veterans.  OGJVAMC has the largest geographic patient service area east of the Mississippi River, encompassing fifteen Michigan counties and ten counties in northeastern Wisconsin.  It is home to approximately 57,000 Veterans, over 26,000 of whom are enrolled in VA’s health care system. OGJVAMC employs 686 staff at its main facility and CBOCs, including 39 licensed physicians, 217 nurses, and 62 mental health professionals that provide primary and selected secondary health care.</p>
<p>OGJVAMC is a primary and secondary level care facility with 17 acute care, general medicine beds. The main facility has an Urgent Care Center, and collaborates with larger VA Medical Centers in Milwaukee and Madison, WI, as well as local community health facilities to provide higher-level emergency and specialty care services.  OGJVAMC also provides rehabilitation and extended care, including palliative and hospice care, in its 40-bed Community Living Center.</p>

<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>Leaders in rural healthcare-focused on excellence-putting Veterans first.</p>
<p>Our mission remains as valid today as it did when first spoken by President Lincoln in 1865 – <strong><em>“….to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan…”<br />
</em></strong></p>
<h3>Core Values</h3>
<p>VA embraces five &#8220;Core Values&#8221; for all of our employees. These five core values (I.C.A.R.E.) are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Act with high moral principle. Adhere to the highest professional standards. Maintain the trust and confidence of all with whom I engage.</li>
<li><strong>Commitment:</strong> Work diligently to serve Veterans and other beneficiaries. Be driven by an earnest belief in VA’s mission. Fulfill my individual responsibilities and organizational responsibilities.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy:</strong> Be truly Veteran-centric by identifying, fully considering, and appropriately advancing the interests of Veterans and other beneficiaries.</li>
<li><strong>Respect:</strong> Treat all those I serve and with whom I work with dignity and respect. Show respect to earn it.</li>
<li><strong>Excellence:</strong> Strive for the highest quality and continuous improvement. Be thoughtful and decisive in leadership, accountable for my actions, willing to admit mistakes, and rigorous in correcting them.</li>
</ul>
