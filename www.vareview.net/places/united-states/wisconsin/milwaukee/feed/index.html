				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center is located on 125 acres on the western edge of Milwaukee and part of VA Integrated Services Network 12 (VISN 12), which includes facilities in Iron Mountain, MI; Tomah and Madison, WI, and North Chicago, Hines, and Chicago. The Medical Center delivers primary, secondary, and tertiary medical care in 168 care acute operating beds and provides over 500,000 visits annually through an extensive outpatient program. The nursing home care unit of 113 beds offers geriatric programming and the 356 domiciliary beds are the locus of programs in Substance Abuse Rehabilitation, Psychiatric Rehabilitation and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder care.</p>
<p>In an effort to improve access to veterans in Milwaukee County, the VAMC has deployed a mobile clinic that provides primary care four days a week to veterans. The Medical Center also assists the Vet Center located in the City of Milwaukee. In addition, this Medical Center participates in a four-way partnership with the WDVA, the Center for Veterans Issues, Ltd., and the Social Development Commission, to operate Vets Place Central, a 72-bed transitional housing program. Milwaukee also has community based outpatient clinics in Appleton, Cleveland, Green Bay, and Union Grove, Wisconsin. These programs serve a veteran population of 234,953 in southeastern and east central Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Special programs include interventional radiology, cardiac surgery, comprehensive cancer care including radiation therapy, an extensive telemedicine program with the Iron Mountain, MI VAMC, a Spinal Cord Injury Unit, and, in long term care, a Geriatric Evaluation and Management Program and a palliative care program.</p>
<p>The Medical Center is the VA Great Lakes Health Care System&#8217;s northern tier hub for both imaging, and pathology/ laboratory medicine.</p>
