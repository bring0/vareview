<h3> VA Portland History</h3>
<h4>1920’s United States Public Health Service Hospital for Veterans &#8211; Portland</h4>
<p>In November 1921, a hospital for Veterans was opened in Portland by the United States Public Health Service. On May 1, 1922, it was transferred from the Public Health Service to the United States Veterans Bureau, the preceding organizational name of the Veterans Administration that was later established in 1930.  In 1988, President Reagan signed legislation to elevate VA to Cabinet status and, on March 15, 1989, the Veterans Administration became the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The Department included three main elements: the Veterans Health Services and Research Administration, which was renamed the <a title="VHA" href="http://www.va.gov/health/aboutvha.asp">Veterans Health Administration</a>; the <a title="VBA" href="http://www.benefits.va.gov/benefits/">Veterans Benefits Administration</a>; and the <a title="NCA" href="http://www.cem.va.gov/">National Cemetery System (Administration)</a>. This organization remains the same today.  VA Portland is part of the <a title="VISN 20" href="http://www.va.gov/directory/guide/region.asp?ID=1020">Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 20 Northwest Network</a>.</p>
<p>In January 1926, the Sam Jackson family of Portland and <a title="OHSU" href="http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/">Oregon Health &amp; Science University</a> (OHSU) deeded 25 acres on Marquam Hill in Portland to the United States Veterans Bureau for a Veteran hospital; the value of the property at that time was about $2,750 per acre. Initial site preparation was started on Feb. 3, 1927, with construction for the original hospital commencing one year later. The first 13 buildings were activated in December 1928 and formally dedicated later in 1929. In 1932, Portland VA Medical Center (PVAMC) Building #16 was built &#8211; this is the only remaining original building that is now occupied by Human Resources.</p>
<p>The VA has been serving Veterans in Vancouver since May 1946 when President Truman authorized the transfer of the U.S. Army Barnes General Hospital to the Veterans Administration.  The Vancouver Division has grown steadily with extensive services and is the largest VAPORHCS facility second only to the main Portland medical center.</p>
<p>The main hospital in Portland (&#8220;PVAMC&#8221;) was completed and dedicated in 1987 and opened to patients in February 1988.</p>
<p>In Oct., 2014, to better reflect the system-wide spectrum of care, &#8220;PVAMC&#8221; changed its name from &#8220;Portland VA Medical Center&#8221; to VA Portland Health Care System (VAPORHCS).</p>
<p>Not long before 9-11, VA Portland basically had two sites of care – Portland and Vancouver. Today we host 12 care facilities from Astoria to Newport to Bend and other sites in between directly serving more than 26 counties across the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Honor America&#8217;s Veterans by providing exceptional health care that improves their health and well-being.</p>
<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>VHA will continue to be the benchmark of excellence and value in health care and benefits by providing exemplary services that are both patient centered and evidence based.</p>
<p>This care will be delivered by engaged, collaborative teams in an integrated environment that supports learning, discovery and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>It will emphasize prevention and population health and contribute to the nation&#8217;s well-being through education, research and service in national emergencies.</p>
