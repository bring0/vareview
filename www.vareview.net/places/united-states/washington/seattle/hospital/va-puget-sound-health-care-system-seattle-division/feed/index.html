The parking was horrible but with the new parking garage it is better. The building is under constant construction and you have to walk miles to get to anything. I walked out from my pre surgery because I felt I would die there. People who were they for a consultant were stacked in the waiting room with people there to get surgery that day. Not to mention I was the youngest there by about 50 years.&lt;/div&gt;]]></description>
