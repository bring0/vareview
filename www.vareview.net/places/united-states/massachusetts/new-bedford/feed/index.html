				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New Bedford VA Community-Based Outpatient Clinic provides a local, comprehensive primary health care option for Veterans in southeastern Massachusetts and parts of Rhode Island.</p>
<p>Located at 175 Elm Street, the facility was renovated in 2014 to expand services and improve patient access. Improvements included adding a physical therapy clinic, women&#8217;s health exam rooms, additional exam rooms and restrooms, renovated space for home-based primary care support, and an enhanced reception area where customer service can assist up to four Veterans at once. Climate control and security systems were also upgraded, as were information technology services, enhancing telemedicine capabilities.</p>
<p>Every patient has a Primary Care Provider who coordinates all their health care needs, coordinating care from a select team of doctors, nurses, therapists, social workers, pharmacists and nutritionists, and providing easy access to any of the Providence VA Medical Center&#8217;s 32 subspecialty clinics. For more information on how to enroll in the Community Based Outpatient Clinic, please contact Patient Services at (401) 457-3300 or the Telephone Assistant Point (TAP) Line at (401) 457-3336.</p>
