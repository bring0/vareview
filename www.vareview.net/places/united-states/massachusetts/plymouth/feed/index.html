				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>VA Boston Healthcare System serves Veterans through the delivery of timely quality care by staff who demonstrate outstanding customer service, the advancement of health care through research, and the education of tomorrow’s health care providers.</p>
<p>The new Plymouth outreach clinic located at 116 Long Pond Road, Suite 4, offers Primary Care services and access to specialty care through telemedicine to Veterans residing in and around Plymouth.</p>
<p>Some advantages to using the Plymouth clinic are having one primary care doctor to coordinate care on an ongoing basis, receiving primary medical care closer to home reducing travel time and the eligibility for specialty outpatient care.</p>
<p>The clinic is conveniently located on the first floor.  It’s easily accessible off route 3, has ample parking available and is accessible by public transportation.</p>
<p>The clinic will be open for business Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and patients can schedule appointments by calling the Patient Call Center toll free at 800-865-3384.</p>
