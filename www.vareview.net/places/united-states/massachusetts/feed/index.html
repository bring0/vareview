				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Important Announcement for Worcester VA Patients</h3>
<p>The Worcester Community-Based Outpatient Clinic now falls under VA Central Western Massachusetts Healthcare System. In addition to Worcester, the system includes outpatient clinics in Springfield, Fitchburg, Pittsfield, and Greenfield, and a medical center in Northampton.</p>
<p><strong>How does this affect you?</strong></p>
<p>Your medical provider does not change.</p>
<p>As of April 30, 2012:</p>
<p><strong>Appointments</strong>. For appointments in Worcester, call the VA Central Western Massachusetts Call Center at 1-800-893-1522.</p>
<p><strong>Records</strong>. Your medical record will now be assigned to VA Central Western Massachusetts. We ask for your patience over the next few months as appointments and prescription processing times may be slightly extended due to a necessary transfer of records.</p>
<p><strong>Pharmacy</strong>. If you see a Worcester provider, a VA Central Western Massachusetts VA Pharmacy, such as the one in Worcester, will fill your prescriptions. However, if you see a Boston provider, a VA Boston pharmacy will fill your prescriptions &#8212; not Worcester. Your prescription refill phone numbers will change &#8212; call the number on your prescription vial for refills (it may be a new one).</p>
<p><strong>Labs</strong>. Lab tests ordered by Boston providers must be done at a Boston lab. They will not be done at a VA Central Western Massachusetts Lab, such as the lab in Worcester. Lab tests ordered by Worcester providers will be done at a VA Central Western Massachusetts lab, such as the lab in Worcester.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>The Worcester clinic was established after the end of World War II in 1946 as one of 18 VA field offices in Massachusetts. The Worcester clinic has been located at its new site since May 18, 1993. The clinic offers ample free parking and is accessible via public transportation. In October 1, 2011, the clinic was assigned to VA Central Western Massachusetts Healthcare System.</p>
