<p>VA Western New York Healthcare System (VAWNYHS), part of VA Health Care Upstate New York (VISN 2), consists of two health care facilities in Buffalo and Batavia, as well as community based outpatient clinics in Dunkirk, Jamestown, Lackawanna, Lockport, Niagara Falls, Olean and Springville.</p>
<p>The Buffalo VA Medical Center opened in 1950 and provides medical, surgical, mental health and long term care services through a range of inpatient and outpatient programs. It is the main referral center for cardiac surgery, cardiology and comprehensive cancer care for central and western New York and northern Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The Batavia facility opened its doors in 1933. It provides geriatric and rehabilitation services, separate residential post traumatic stress disorder units for men and women, and outpatient services. In 1995, a New York State Veterans Home was built on the Batavia grounds making additional extended care available.</p>
<p>VAWNYHS is academically affiliated with the State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo along with 66 additional universities and professional schools in biomedical sciences, audiology, dentistry, dietetics, health care administration, medicine, nursing, nurse anesthesia, occupational and physical therapy, pharmacy, psychology, speech pathology, and social work.</p>
<p>VAWNYHS researchers have earned worldwide acclaim in developing the cardiac pacemaker. Recent breakthroughs in the study of tinnitus, progress toward a vaccine for childhood ear infections, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease promise benefits to all mankind.</p>
