<li>Just like any private doctor’s office, the Lake Jackson VA Outpatient Clinic Prime Care Teams are designed to see patients by appointment. Although we will do our best to accommodate you if you come in as a walk-in, we cannot guarantee how long your wait might be. That is why we encourage you to contact the Telecare Appointment Center to schedule an appointment and avoid long wait times.</li>
<li>If, for some reason, you cannot keep your appointment, please immediately call the Network Telecare and Appointment Center and choose Option 3, to reschedule or cancel. Please cancel at least 24 hours in advance so we can offer your appointment to another Veteran.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Flu Shots</h3>
<p>We are now capable of providing flu shots. Please notify your Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) if you are interested. For more information about influenza and the flu vaccine, contact the Preventive Medicine Program at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center at 713-794-8768 or visit the CDC website at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu">http://www.cdc.gov/flu</a>.</p>
<h3>Medication Reconciliation</h3>
<p>The Lake Jackson VA Outpatient Clinic does not dispense medication &#8211; all prescriptions will be mailed to you. Prescriptions can be refilled by three different ways:</p>
<p dir="ltr">     1. Logon to <a href="http://www.myhealth.va.gov/">www.myhealth.va.gov</a> via My Health-E Vet<br />
2. Contact the automated telephone refill line 713-794-7648 or<br />
Toll Free 1-800-454-1062<br />
3. Mail in the refill form (this paperwork arrives with medications in the mail).</p>
<p dir="ltr">VA will not fill or rewrite prescriptions prescribed by your private physician. The VA will provide medications that are prescribed by VA providers in conjunction with VA medical care.</p>
