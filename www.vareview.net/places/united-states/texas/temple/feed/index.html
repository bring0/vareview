				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) is a new model of Primary Care delivery that is flexible, all-inclusive and holistic. The overriding principles of this transformation are to be people-centric, results-oriented, and forward-thinking.</p>
<p>The PACT will focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing Partnerships with Veterans</li>
<li>Providing Improved Access to Care</li>
<li>Coordination of Care</li>
<li>Team-Based Care</li>
</ul>
<p>We will deliver this new model of care to approximately 6,000 Veterans at this clinic. Each veteran will be assigned to a core Teamlet. Each Teamlet will coordinate and provide all the Veteran’s outpatient health care needs.</p>
<p>Each of the five teamlets is comprised of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary Care Provider</li>
<li>Registered Nurse</li>
<li>Licensed Practical Nurse</li>
<li>Clerical Associate</li>
</ul>
<p>Each core teamlet will be assisted at this site by a psychologist, social worker, dietitian, and clinical pharmacist. Other specialists will visit the site.</p>
<p>The teamlet will develop personal relationships with the Veterans, transforming the healthcare experience. The focus is on forging trusted, personal relationships.</p>
<p>We will strive to provide access to the veteran when such is needed. Our goal is to provide this access to Veterans even when they do not have an appointment. Veterans will also be able to communicate with their team through secure messaging through our internet portal (www.myhealth.va.gov), and by telephone.</p>
