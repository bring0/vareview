Appointments are cancelled without being rescheduled by the clinic. Lack of oversight in the Pharmacy. There is a pharmacy tech who will outright pretend to be the pharmacist to tell you why you cannot get your medications and lie about when/how you reordered them. Medication review information is poor to none. Physician Assistants are called Doctor. PAs often lack oversight as required by law-- a doctor is assigned but not present. The use of student doctors as first line reviewing and meeting with patients means that when they relay information, they are doing so without a full understanding of the issues of former military such as environmental exposure. The ER is always a 3-4 hour wait, regardless of how many veterans are in the waiting room. Even though there were open ER bays, I was left in a walkway for 3 hours waiting for a pregnancy test before they would treat men. I had a hysterectomy over 10 years prior. They never asked and claimed it was not in my records even though the Women&#039;s clinic was given that information. It is hard to understand the propensity of foreign-born doctors and nurses with heavy accents leading to incorrect medical information. There are clinics that discourage veterans from their services by manipulating wait times and appointment times, if you can even get a referral. They neglect to list diagnoses that have been proven and/or downplay the impact of a disease process on daily life.&lt;/div&gt;]]></description>
