				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The South Texas Veterans Health Care System (STVHCS) continually seeks to improve our delivery of health care services and is excited about our existing Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) Program. STVHCS contracts with community providers to provide primary care to Veterans closer to their home or work.</p>
<p>Please call STVHCS Telecare at 1-888-686-6350 for more information on locations, assignments, appointments and services.</p>
<p>Your Primary Care Provider will provide you with:<br />
• Annual Physical Exam (Not limited to just the annual physical exam)<br />
• Continuous Primary Care<br />
• Pneumonia Vaccine<br />
• Routine Labs and X-rays<br />
• Prescriptions</p>
<p>In addition to the primary care services you receive from this clinic, the full array of the VA medical services (including specialty tests and consultations) will be made available through the STVHCS VA Medical Center.</p>
<p>South Texas Contract Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs)</p>
<p>South Texas Veterans Health Care System (STVHCS) began contracting with local primary care providers in 1997 to improve the access to health care services for Veterans closer to their home or work.</p>
<p>These clinics were established to provide primary care to the Veteran in their community. Primary Care is a term used when one physician or physician group coordinates all of your medical care. This physician (group) will be the doctor you will always see. When needed, he/she will refer you to other physicians for specialty tests or treatments. These consultations will be done at the nearest STVHCS VA facility. After the consult is completed, reports of this care will be returned to your primary care provider by entering them into your medical records through the computerized patient record system (CPRS) so your primary care provider can continue to coordinate your care.</p>
<p>These clinics are by enrollment only and interested Veterans should call our Telephone Liaison Care Nurse Program at 1-888-686-6350 for further information and enrollment. Please do not call or visit these clinics for an appointment until you have called to enroll and received a confirmation of enrollment letter and clinic brochure.</p>
