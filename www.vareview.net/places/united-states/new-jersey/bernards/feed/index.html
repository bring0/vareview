				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Director of the VA New Jersey Health Care System (VANJHCS) may be contacted at (973) 676-1000 x1211. The VANJHCS is a consolidated facility comprised of two main campuses, one in East Orange, the corporate office located in Northeastern New Jersey within the greater New York metropolitan area, and one in Lyons, 22 miles to the west of the East Orange Campus.</p>
<p>A satellite outpatient clinic is located in Brick, and access points are located in Elizabeth, Hackensack, Hamilton, Jersey City, Morristown,  Paterson, Piscataway and Tinton Falls. Primary care is emphasized at the VANJHCS. Veterans are assigned their own health care providers whom they see on a regular basis. Access to a wide variety of specialists is available through the primary providers. In addition to general medical, psychiatry, and long-term care, a full range of medical and surgical subspecialty care is provided to veterans of the VANJHCS in a variety of special programs as listed below. Because the VANJHCS is dedicated to developing programs that meet all veterans&#8217; needs, teams of physicians, nurses, therapists, social workers and others all work together to develop programs of distinction that often become models for the health care field.</p>
<p>The System&#8217;s Diabetes Education, Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Prosthetics, Homeless Outreach Programs, and others have been recognized for outstanding achievement both within the Department of Veterans Affairs and the general health care community. A recognized leader in research, the VANJHCS maintains a very active research program with over 60 investigators conducting pioneering work in areas such as infectious disease, cardiovascular disease, and the health effects of smoking. The East Orange Campus was selected as one of two new research centers that are looking at ways to care for active duty patients and veterans with war-related illnesses.</p>
