<p><b><strong>Non-VA Medical Care Program</strong></b></p>
<p>Non-VA medical care is provided to eligible Veterans by community-based providers when those services are not &#8220;feasibly&#8221; available from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facility. The use of non-VA medical care is governed by federal laws covering eligibility criteria and other policies specifying when and in what situations it can be used. An authorization for treatment in the community is required for non-VA medical care – unless the medical event is an emergency. Emergency events may be reimbursed on behalf of the Veteran in certain cases.</p>
<p><em>Visit our <a href="http://www.va.gov/PURCHASEDCARE/programs/veterans/nonvacare/index.asp">Non-VA Medical Care Program page</a> for more information.</em></p>
<p><b><strong>Social Work</strong></b></p>
<p>Social workers assist and advocate for Veterans and their families to resolve psychological, emotional, and financial stresses related to illness and disability. They are also actively involved in outreach, pre-admission and aftercare phases of VA&#8217;s health care programs. Social Work Service at the VA operates closely with all inpatient and outpatient medical, psychiatric, long-term care and other specialty services.</p>
<p>Social workers at the VA assist Veterans, dependents, families, and caregivers in many ways. Assistance includes providing culturally competent psycho-social assessment and care, abuse reporting, and community resource and referral for transportation, housing, meals and financial assistance.</p>
<p>Social workers help with post-hospitalization planning and ongoing assistance with health care needs. They also provide counseling to individuals, families, and groups, as well as education about health issues, long-term health care planning, end of life planning, executing Advance Directives, privacy rights, release of information, informed consent policy, conservatorship, and Veterans&#8217; benefits.

<p><b><strong>Non-VA Medical Care Program</strong></b></p>
<p>Non-VA medical care is provided to eligible Veterans by community-based providers when those services are not &#8220;feasibly&#8221; available from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facility. The use of non-VA medical care is governed by federal laws covering eligibility criteria and other policies specifying when and in what situations it can be used. An authorization for treatment in the community is required for non-VA medical care – unless the medical event is an emergency. Emergency events may be reimbursed on behalf of the Veteran in certain cases.</p>
<p><em>Visit our <a href="http://www.va.gov/PURCHASEDCARE/programs/veterans/nonvacare/index.asp">Non-VA Medical Care Program page</a> for more information.</em></p>
<p><b><strong>Social Work</strong></b></p>
<p>Social workers assist and advocate for Veterans and their families to resolve psychological, emotional, and financial stresses related to illness and disability. They are also actively involved in outreach, pre-admission and aftercare phases of VA&#8217;s health care programs. Social Work Service at the VA operates closely with all inpatient and outpatient medical, psychiatric, long-term care and other specialty services.</p>
<p>Social workers at the VA assist Veterans, dependents, families, and caregivers in many ways. Assistance includes providing culturally competent psycho-social assessment and care, abuse reporting, and community resource and referral for transportation, housing, meals and financial assistance.</p>
<p>Social workers help with post-hospitalization planning and ongoing assistance with health care needs. They also provide counseling to individuals, families, and groups, as well as education about health issues, long-term health care planning, end of life planning, executing Advance Directives, privacy rights, release of information, informed consent policy, conservatorship, and Veterans&#8217; benefits.
