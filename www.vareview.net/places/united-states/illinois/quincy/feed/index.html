				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p>The Quincy Clinic is an outpatient facility where veterans can be treated for medical problems and routine health maintenance as an alternative to traveling to the VA Medical Center.</p>
<p>Patients are seen by scheduled appointments.</p>
<p>Services provided by the Quincy Clinic include physician evaluations, basic x-rays, routine laboratory testing, and EKGs (electrocardiograms). The clinic operates like a doctor&#8217;s office, <strong>NOT</strong> an emergency center, proving primary care, preventative health, and wellness services. A specific healthcare team is assigned to address your healthcare needs. You may be referred to Iowa City VA Medical Center for specialty treatment. It is required that you call ahead for an appointment. Initial supplies of newly prescribed medications are available through a local pharmacy. Refills will be mailed from the VA Iowa City Health Care System.</p>
<p><strong>Parking</strong></p>
<p>Parking is free on the premises.</p>
