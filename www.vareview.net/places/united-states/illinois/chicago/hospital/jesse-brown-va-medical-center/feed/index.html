I will say that years ago (when it was known as Westside VA), it was a dump. People selling drugs outside, roaming packs of people without appointments hanging around, etc.

In 2016, the improvements this VA has made are impressive. The doctors are knowledgable, nurses are friendly, and people are always willing to help. It&#039;s not like other hospitals I&#039;ve been to. The VA, and Jesse Brown in particular, is BUSY. Constantly. Easily 100+ people outside and in the lobby at 8 o&#039;clock in the morning. A lot of veterans don&#039;t just go to Jesse Brown to receive care, but use it as a community center. 

They may not be the most efficient organization in the country, but they do their best and have been sincerely and successfully making improvements.&lt;/div&gt;]]></description>
