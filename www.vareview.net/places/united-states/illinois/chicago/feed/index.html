				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="page-title">About the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center</h2>
<p>The Jesse Brown VA Medical Center consists of a 200-bed acute care facility and four community based outpatient clinics (CBOCs). Jesse Brown VAMC provides care to approximately 62,000 enrolled veterans who reside in the City of Chicago and Cook County, Illinois, and in four counties in northwestern Indiana. In FY10, the medical center had over 8100 inpatient admissions and 560,000 outpatient visits. A budget of over $355 million supports approximately 2,000 full-time equivalent staff, including 200+ physicians and 450 nurses, with 500+ volunteers providing service and care at Jesse Brown VAMC and CBOCs.</p>
<p>In May 2008, the medical center opened its new inpatient bed tower pavilion, which includes seven surgical suites, cystology, intensive care, inpatient dialysis, an outpatient surgical center and a chapel. The medical center’s strategic priority is the “heart of the Veterans Community” and as Provider of Choice for veterans in the Chicago area. JBVAMC established a “We Are Here” outreach campaign to inform veterans about the health care benefits they have earned through their service to our country and the specific services available to them at Jesse Brown VA Medical Center.</p>
<p>Formerly known as the West Side VA Medical Center, the facility was renamed in 2004 for the Honorable Jesse Brown, who served as Secretary for Veterans Affairs from 1993 to 1997.</p>
<p>Affiliations: Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern University and University of Illinois at Chicago Medical School, with over 900 program residents caring for our veterans yearly.</p>
<h2>Community-Based Outpatient Clinics</h2>
<p>In addition to our main facility in Chicago, we offer services in four community-based outpatient clinics. These clinics are located in —</p>
