				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bldg 1523<br />
<strong>(847) 688-5568</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hours<br />
</strong>Monday-Friday 0700-1500</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong></p>
<p>Named in honor of the U.S. Navy steamer that was in service from 1862 to 1865, USS Red Rover is one of four Branch Medical Clinics that are part of the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center and is located in Great Lakes, Illinois.</p>
<p>As the “Gateway to the Navy,” the clinic processes more than 40,000 enlisted recruits annually. Each recruit is assigned to a division, and the divisions are processed as a unit, which can be as large as 100 recruits.</p>
<p><strong>Services</strong></p>
<p>In-processing “tasks” are divided into 4 processing days called “P Days.” During these days, recruits receive a substantial number of vital medical and dental tasks, ensuring they are physically ready for their role in the U.S. Navy.</p>
<p>During P-1 and P-2, recruits are registered into VISTA, AHLTA and the Composite Health Care System (CHCS) and their initial medical record is created; they are given a Tuberculin Skin Test (TST), a blood draw, and their DNA cards are collected.</p>
<p>During P-3 and P-4, recruits receive male/female wellness counseling (female wellness exam and pregnancy counseling), an average of 6 immunizations, dental x-ray and exams, an optometry exam (same-day glasses) and a physician exam (for recruits with allergies, high body-mass index, physical activity issues and current complaints). Recruits return on their 5-2 day of training to receive an average of 3 final immunizations.</p>
<p>In 9 to 10 combined minutes, a recruit receives a dental exam, three x-rays and a forensics exam. This would typically average an hour outside of the training environment. In a year, USS Red Rover dental professionals have more than 164,000 patient encounters, more than 46,700 tooth extractions and just fewer than 81,000 routine dental restorations. In total, these procedures would equate to more than $72 million in community dental services.</p>
<p>Annually, the USS Red Rover produces nearly 20,000 glasses, administers 270,000 immunizations, provides approximately 10,000 gynecological exams, administers 40,000 hearing exams, and collects and examines 200,000 tubes of blood.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>As background on the namesake, USS Red Rover was commissioned in December 1862 and was used during the Civil War as hospital ship for the Mississippi Squadron. Her medical complement included nurses from the Catholic order Sisters of the Holy Cross, the first female nurses to serve on board a Navy ship. In addition to caring for and transporting sick and wounded men, she provided medical supplies to Navy ships along the Western Rivers. USS Red Rover was stationed at Mound City, Ill., from December 1864 until November 1865, when she was decommissioned and sold.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bldg 1007<br />
(847) 688-6755</p>
<p><strong>Hours</strong></p>
<p>Monday-Friday 0630-1900</p>
<p>Weekends and Holidays 0630-0900</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong></p>
<p>USS Tranquillity Branch Medical Clinic (Bldg. 1007) Recruit Training Command is the busiest clinic in the U.S. Navy and is staffed by nearly 150 active duty and civilian staff members. As one of three Branch Medical Clinics that are part of the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center, USS Tranquillity provides many services, including ship sick call, primary care, treatment room, sports medicine and rehabilitative therapy (SMART), special physicals, medical records and mental health/recruit evaluation unit (REU).</p>
<p>USS Tranquillity&#8217;s Ship Sick Call Clinics treats approximately 31,000 patients each year, addressing needs that can be satisfied through basic treatment and over-the-counter medications. Primary Care Clinics provides care for nearly 48,000 patients each year for concerns such as upper respiratory infections, unspecified viral infections, pharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, asthma, conjunctivitis, otitis media and dehydration.</p>
<p><strong>Services</strong></p>
<p>The Treatment Room provides care for nearly 5,000 patients a year for the following services: serial blood pressure monitoring, various procedures, crutches, pulmonary-related procedures, and IM/SQ injections (immunizations). USS Tranquillity&#8217;s SMART provides care for nearly 26,000 patients each year, and is responsible for the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of any injury, acute or chronic, affecting the musculoskeletal system. SMART includes physical therapy, podiatry and chiropractic clinics.</p>
<p>USS Tranquillity sees over 6,000 Recruits and active duty each year for special duties qualifications, including nuclear field, submarine, naval aircrew, and diver-explosive ordinance device (EOD). Recruit Mental Health care at USS Tranquillity provides professional psychiatric and psychological assessments to nearly 19,000 Recruits each year. Lastly, they ensures that all recruit health records are complete prior to transfer, and are responsible for coordinating recruit consult appointments with the different specialty clinics at the Lovell FHCC.</p>
<p>As background on the namesake, USS Tranquillity was converted into a hospital ship and commissioned in April 1945, with a bed capacity of 802 and a complement of 568. USS Tranquillity began service as a base hospital at Ulithi and was dispatched in August 1945 to the Palau Island to receive the survivors from the USS Indianapolis and transport them to Guam. She was then assigned to assist the 3rd Fleet by returning 766 patients from Guam to the US. In September 1945, she was assigned to Operation Magic Carpet to return troops from overseas to the US and was designated APH-114. In March 1946, USS Tranquillity was decommissioned. She was struck from the Naval Register in September 1961. Tranquillity received one battle star from World War II service.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (FHCC) is a first-of-its-kind partnership between the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense (DoD), integrating all medical care into a fully-integrated federal health care facility with a single combined VA and Navy mission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Located in North Chicago, Illinois, the Lovell FHCC was established on Oct. 1, 2010.  The arrangement incorporates facilities, services and resources from the North Chicago VA Medical Center (VAMC) and the Naval Health Clinic Great Lakes (NHCGL).  A combined mission of the health care center means active duty military, their family members, military retirees and veterans are all cared for at the facility.  The health care center ensures that nearly 40,000 Navy recruits who transition through Naval Station Great Lakes each year are medically ready.  We care for nearly 67,000 eligible military and retiree beneficiaries each year, and bring Veterans throughout Northern Illinois and Southern Wisconsin first-rate care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our mission is accomplished at three primary locations:</p>
<h3>West Campus</h3>
<p>At our campus in North Chicago, Illinois, the Lovell FHCC provides a full spectrum of health care for our patients, including full medical and surgical care, a large array of medical sub-specialties (cardiology, pulmonary, neurology, etc,), a variety of mental health services (acute and long-term care, post-traumatic stress disorder, homeless domiciliary care, alcohol/drug rehab, etc.), Community Living Center, as well as many other programs.</p>
<h3>East Campus</h3>
<p>At our four branch medical clinics on Naval Station Great Lakes, the Lovell FHCC serves U.S. Navy military members and recruits:</p>
<p>USS Osborne (Bldg. 1017)<br />
USS Tranquillity (Bldg. 1007)<br />
USS Red Rover (Bldg. 1523)<br />
Fisher Clinic (Bldg. 237)</p>
<h3>Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC)</h3>
<p>Evanston, Illinois</p>
<p>Kenosha, Wisconsin</p>
<p>McHenry, Illinois</p>
