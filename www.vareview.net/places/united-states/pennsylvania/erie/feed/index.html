				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Welcome to the Erie VA Medical Center<br />
</strong><em>Empowering Veterans, Honoring Service</em></p>
<p>On behalf of the Erie VA Medical Center (VAMC) staff, welcome to our medical center and thank you for your service!</p>
<p>As World War II was ending, the country’s commitment to war Veterans became even stronger.  In 1951, the Erie community received a brand new medical center solely for the care of Veterans.  Today, Erie VAMC is recognized as a top-performing medical center in the delivery of high-quality health care. We have the honor and privilege to serve more than 23,000 Veterans in a nine-county area within northwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, and southwestern New York.</p>
<p>It is my firm belief that Erie VAMC belongs to the Veterans, and let me assure you, it will stay that way.  We are fully committed to empowering Veterans as we actively seek out patient feedback to improve our services.</p>
<p>We are all here for the Veterans and I will do everything I can to support out staff in enhancing access and care for you.  As an Air Force Veteran, my leadership is continuously guided by the core values that guided my service:  integrity, service before self, and excellence in all we do.  Those are the core values that you can expect from your Erie VA Medical Center.</p>
<p>I am extremely honored to have an opportunity to contribute to Erie VAMC’s long and proud legacy of caring for Veterans.</p>
<p>Again, it is an privilege to welcome you to our medical center!  Hope to see you soon!</p>
<p><strong>David P. Cord</strong><br />
Medical Center Director</p>
