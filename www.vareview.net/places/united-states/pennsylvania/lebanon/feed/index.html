				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>VHA MISSION</strong></p>
<p>Honor America&#8217;s Veterans by providing exceptional health care that improves their health and well-being.</p>
<p><strong>VHA VISION<br />
</strong><br />
To be a patient-centered integrated health care organization for Veterans providing excellent health care, research, and education; an organization where people choose to work; an active community partner; and a back-up for national emergencies.</p>
<p>VHA will continue to be the benchmark of excellence and value in health care and benefits by providing exemplary services that are both patient-centered and evidence-based.</p>
<p>This care will be delivered by engaged, collaborative teams in an integrated environment that supports learning, discovery and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>It will emphasize prevention and population health and contribute to the Nation’s well-being through education, research and service in national emergencies.</p>
<p><strong>CORE VALUES</strong></p>
<p>The Core Values are the basic elements of how we go about our work – they define “who we are” – and form the underlying principles we will use every day in our service to Veterans.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity<br />
Commitment<br />
Advocacy<br />
Respect<br />
Excellence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong>: Act with high moral principle. Adhere to the highest professional standards. Maintain the trust and confidence of all with whom I engage.</p>
<p><strong>Commitment</strong>: Work diligently to serve Veterans and other beneficiaries. Be driven by an earnest belief in VA’s mission. Fulfill my individual responsibilities and organizational responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Advocacy</strong>: Be truly Veteran-centric by identifying, fully considering, and appropriately advancing the interests of Veterans and other beneficiaries.</p>
<p><strong>Respect</strong>: Treat all those I serve and with whom I work with dignity and respect. Show respect to earn it.</p>
<p><strong>Excellence</strong>: Strive for the highest quality and continuous improvement. Be thoughtful and decisive in leadership, accountable for my actions, willing to admit mistakes, and rigorous in correcting them.</p>
<p><strong>VA CORE CHARACTERISTICS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trustworthy</strong>: VA earns the trust of those it serves – every day – through the actions of all employees. They provide care, benefits, and services with compassion, dependability, effectiveness, and transparency.</p>
<p><strong>Accessible</strong>: VA engages and welcomes Veterans and other beneficiaries, facilitating their use of the entire array of its services. Each interaction will be positive and productive.</p>
<p><strong>Quality</strong>: VA provides the highest standard of care and services to Veterans and beneficiaries while managing the cost of its programs and being efficient stewards of all resources entrusted to it by the American people. VA is a model of unrivalled excellence due to employees who are empowered, trusted by their leaders, and respected for their competence and dedication.</p>
<p><strong>Innovative</strong>: VA prizes curiosity and initiative, encourages creative contributions from all employees, seeks continuous improvement, and adapts to remain at the forefront in knowledge, proficiency, and capability to deliver the highest standard of care and services to all of the people it serves.</p>
<p><strong>Agile</strong>: VA anticipates and adapts quickly to current challenges and new requirements by continuously assessing the environment in which it operates and devising solutions to better serve Veterans, other beneficiaries, and Service members.</p>
<p><strong>Integrated</strong>: VA links care and services across the Department; other federal, state, and local agencies; partners; and Veterans Services Organizations to provide useful and understandable programs to Veterans and other beneficiaries. VA’s relationship with the Department of Defense is unique, and VA will nurture it for the benefit of Veterans and Service members.</p>
<p><strong>VHA PRINCIPLES</strong><br />
VHA’s principles are the philosophical pillars that are embedded in VHA’s vision. They are embodied in our goals, objectives, and every initiative undertaken.</p>
<p>Patient Centered<br />
Team Based<br />
Data Driven/Evidence Based<br />
Prevention/Population Health<br />
Providing Value<br />
Continuously Improving</p>
<p><strong>VHA GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. PROVIDE VETERANS PERSONALIZED<sup>1</sup>, PROACTIVE<sup>2</sup>, PATIENT-DRIVEN<sup>3</sup> HEALTH <sup>4</sup> CARE.</strong></p>
<p>a.  <strong><em>VA Health Care Delivery</em></strong> – VA health care partners with each Veteran to create a personalized, proactive strategy to optimize health and well-being, while providing state-of-the art disease management.</p>
<p>b.  <strong><em>Communication</em></strong> – VHA will effectively communicate the VA model and strategy for delivering personalized, proactive, patient-driven health care to employees, Veterans, key partners and stakeholders, and will prepare our workforce to deliver this type of care.</p>
<p>c.  <strong><em>Awareness &amp; Understanding</em></strong> – The VA model of personalized, proactive, patient-driven health care, which is delivered across the continuum from prevention through tertiary care and end of life, will be clearly defined and commonly understood as evidenced by survey results.</p>
<p>d.  <strong><em>Access to Information &amp; Resources</em></strong> – Veterans will have convenient access to information about VA health benefits, their medical records, health information, expert advice, and the ongoing support needed to make informed health decisions and successfully implement their personal health plans.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>e. <strong><em>Quality &amp; Equity</em></strong> – Veterans will receive timely, high quality, personalized, safe effective and equitable health care, irrespective of geography, gender, race, age, culture or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>f.  <strong><em>Innovation &amp; Improvement</em></strong> – VHA will drive an improvement culture by advancing innovation trials, emerging health technologies, and experimentation, through exploration of both constructive failures and dynamic successes, adopting practices that improve care while minimizing and managing acceptable risk.</p>
<p>g.  <strong><em>Collaboration</em></strong> – VHA will strengthen collaborations within communities, and with organizations such as the Department of Defense, the Department of Health and Human Services, academic affiliates, and other service organizations.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup>Personalized &#8211; a dynamic adaptation or customization of recommended education, prevention and treatment that is specifically relevant to the individual user, based on the user’s history, clinical presentation, lifestyle, behavior and preferences.<br />
<sup>2</sup>Proactive &#8211; acting in advance of a likely future situation, rather than just reacting; taking initiative to make things happen rather than just adjusting to a situation or waiting for something to happen.<br />
<sup>3</sup>Patient-Driven – an engagement between a patient and a health care system where the patient is the source of control such that their health care is based in their needs, values, and how the patient wants to live<br />
<sup>4</sup>Health &#8211; a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (World Health Organization)<br />
<sup>5</sup>Personal Health Plan &#8211; A uniquely personalized plan for health that is built upon each patient’s values, conditions, needs and circumstances which uses the most appropriate interventions and strategies. It addresses the skills and support needed to help engaged patients manage their disease, in order to regain and maintain optimal health and wellbeing, or manage chronic disease and disability to the greatest extent possible.<br />
<strong>2. ACHIEVE MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN HEALTH OUTCOMES.</strong></p>
<p>a. <strong><em> Expectations</em></strong> – VHA performance expectations will be aligned to the VHA strategic goals.</p>
<p>b.  <strong><em>Incentives</em></strong> – Incentives will be in place for individual, team and organizational performance and results consistent with VHA strategic goals and objectives.</p>
<p><strong>3. ALIGN RESOURCES TO DELIVER SUSTAINED VALUE TO VETERANS.</strong></p>
<p>a.  <strong><em>Support Services</em></strong> – VA and VHA support services (e.g., contracting, human resources, information technology) will be aligned and coordinated in ways to ensure agile responses to VISN/program needs related to health care.</p>
<p>b.  <strong><em>Operational Processes</em></strong> – Clinical operations and business processes will be aligned to support implementation of the VA model of personalized, proactive, patient-driven health care, enabled through the reduction or elimination of distracting and unnecessary program mandates and underutilized physical resources.</p>
<p>c.  <strong><em>Resources</em></strong> – The Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) model will be continually updated to better support personalized, proactive, patient-driven health care.</p>
<p>d.  <strong><em>Agile Footprint</em></strong> – VHA health delivery system capital footprints will be right-sized and aligned consistent with market projections, while ensuring agility to allow for rapid adaptation to policy changes, divestiture of unnecessary facilities and land, and changing Veteran demographics.</p>
<p>e.  <strong><em>Capital Investments</em></strong> – Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) proposals submitted from VHA will be consistent with current fiscal realities, long-range strategic imperatives, and the VA model of personalized, proactive, patient-driven health care.</p>
<p>f.  <strong><em>IT Investments</em></strong> – Information technology investments will be prioritized and made timely to support personalized, proactive health care improvements in a highly responsive manner.</p>
<p>g.  <strong><em>Local Flexibility</em></strong> – There will be flexibility for appropriate local decision making (e.g., make vs. buy decisions) to address local variation in population needs, such that VISNs, VAMCs and market area health systems can adapt locally to maximize access to and quality of a consistent package of VHA health care services.</p>
<p>h.  <strong><em>Leadership</em></strong> – VHA will achieve a highly effective, innovative, data-driven, evidence-based, continuously improving, and reliable health care system. By 2017, the system will be nationally recognized as a leader for population health improvement strategies, personalized care, and maximizing health outcomes in a cost-effective and sustainable manner.</p>
