<p>More than 57,500 Veterans are enrolled for health care at PVAMC, with nearly 463,000 visits in 2012.  The Medical Center has an operating budget of more than $474 million and focuses on several mission areas: providing health care, conducting medical research, training health care professionals for the future, and being prepared to serve in the event of a crisis or emergency.</p>
