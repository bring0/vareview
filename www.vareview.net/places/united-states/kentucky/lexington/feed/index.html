				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="page-title">About the Lexington VA Medical Center</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.lexington.va.gov/">Lexington Veterans Affairs Medical Center</a> was established in 1931 and is accredited by The Joint Commission. The facility is comprised of two divisions, Leestown and Cooper, with community based outpatient clinics located in Berea, Hazard, Morehead, and Somerset.</p>
<p>The Leestown Division (LD), located at 2250 Leestown Road, offers inpatient Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and substance abuse treatment, nursing home care, hospice and respite services, home based primary care, prosthetics and orthotics, geriatrics, optometry, mental health as well as primary care and women&#8217;s health.</p>
<p>The Cooper Division, located at 1101 Veterans Drive, offers emergency care, inpatient medical-surgical care, acute psychiatry, intensive and progressive care units, (includes Cardiac Cath Lab) ambulatory surgery, medicine and surgery specialty clinics, and hemodialysis.</p>
<p>The medical center is designated as the <a href="http://www.polytrauma.va.gov/facilities/Lexington.asp">Polytrauma Site</a> for the <a href="http://www.visn9.va.gov/" target="_blank">VA MidSouth Healthcare Network (VISN 9)</a>, where a team of experts coordinate care and services across the network for severly injured soldiers.</p>
<p>Referral arrangements for nursing home care are established with the Thompson-Hood State Veterans Home in Wilmore, Kentucky as well as with the Eastern Kentucky State Veterans Home in Hazard, Kentucky.</p>
<p>The veteran population in Lexington&#8217;s primary service area is estimated at more than 83,000. The medical center is part of the VA MidSouth Healthcare Network or VISN 9, which consists of six VA medical centers in Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia with community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) in those states as well as Arkansas, Mississippi, Virginia, and Indiana.</p>
<p>The medical center received the Kentucky Hospital Association Quality Award in 2007, and in 2002, the John M. Eisenberg Patient Safety Award for advocacy as it relates to the medical center&#8217;s disclosure policy on medical errors.</p>
