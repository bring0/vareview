<p>The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) accredits the G.V. (Sonny) Medical Center.  Joint Commission’s  mission is to improve the quality of care provided to the public through the provision of healthcare accreditation and related services that support performance improvement in healthcare organizations.  We&#8217;ve been awarded accreditation with commendation, because we strive to provide the very best possible care, and we&#8217;ve proven it by meeting Joint Commission&#8217;s  standards for high quality health care.</p>

If you have any concerns, complaints, compliments, or you just need information or assistance, the patient advocates are available Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on the first floor of the main hospital building (room D-114) or at hospital extension 1253.</p>
