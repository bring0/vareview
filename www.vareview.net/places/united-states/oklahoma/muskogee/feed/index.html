				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Eastern Oklahoma VA Health Care System (EOVAHCS) serves more than 47,000 Veterans in 25 counties in eastern Oklahoma.</p>
<p>EOVAHCS operates the Jack C. Montgomery VA Medical Center in Muskogee, Okla. which has 89 operating beds, including inpatient behavioral health and inpatient rehabilitation. EOVAHCS also operates an outpatient clinic at the Muskogee facility, behavioral medicine clinics in Muskogee and Tulsa  and community based outpatient clinics in Tulsa, Hartshorne, and Vinita, Okla.</p>
<p>Since 1923, our staff has been dedicated to providing quality health care to Veterans in eastern Oklahoma. The Jack C. Montgomery VA Medical Center has a proud legacy as we were the first VA Medical Center in the Nation to be named after a Native American.</p>
<p>On Nov. 30, 2006, the Muskogee VA Medical Center was rededicated as the Jack C. Montgomery VA Medical Center in honor of WWII Veteran and Medal of Honor recipient Jack C. Montgomery.  Our Community-Based Outpatient Clinic in Tulsa is also named after a Native American.  On May 27, 2008, the Tulsa Clinic was rededicated as the Ernest Childers VA Outpatient Clinic after Ernest Childers, a WWII Veteran and Medal of Honor recipient.</p>
<p>Our motto is “Excellence Starts Here” and we want to make that evident when you visit our main hospital in Muskogee or any of our clinics in Tulsa, Hartshorne or Vinita.</p>
<p>We offer a variety of primary and secondary levels of inpatient medical and surgical care, along with outpatient primary and consultative care in medicine, surgery and psychiatry.</p>
<p>While you are here, please take some time to set up your own profile in <a title="My HealtheVet" href="https://www.myhealth.va.gov/index.html">My HealtheVet</a>.  At My HealtheVet, you can read more about what interests you, as well as manage your prescriptions, appointments, and other medical information.</p>
<p>Please consider this site as an extension of our relationship with you as a member of our community, a Veteran, a patient, or family member of one of our patients.</p>
<p><strong>Community-Based Outpatient Clinics</strong><br />
In addition to our main facility in Muskogee, we offer services in three community-based outpatient clinics. These clinics are located in —</p>
