They will NOT inform you that the lot is full until you are stuck inside or have to back out and hope you don&#039;t hit someone

The last time I got pissed at a valet person was in a video game.

 The last time I was told that a lot is full, there was a glaring sign at the electronic entrance of the parking lot.

The last time I got a dent in my car, someone else thought they had Asian geometry skills on parking in a garage.

 --The valet workers here for parking are incompetent &quot;F-1 &quot; expired pigs who shove so many cars into a tight 1 floor 1 way space in the parking garage, You could swear you are looking at their backlogged system files rather than their parking structure...

It would take years to clean this hard drive....I mean parking lot out without damaging the contents..

They crammer a single set of parking spaces suitable for 6-15 cars via preset available slots...and  banged another  14 cars so tightly into an already confined spacing.. you could cause the alarms to go off just by opening your car window..

Its a fire hazard. Its a safety concern. And its a liability... oh wait a minute... valet ppl say they aren&#039;t responsible for damages to your vehicle when unattended...

Uhhh if I let you drive it yourself to a parking spot...dam well your liable... 

Asians in general are supposed to be good in math...how the hell can you for a Chrysler Town and Country Limited into a subcompact space?.....that&#039;s essentially what they did with multiple cars...

You wonder why you find brand new &quot;decals&quot; on your vehicle...That no Topping rule is suitable for them in particular..

I&#039;m sticking with street parking..&lt;/div&gt;]]></description>

This review is not for the entire hospital as I was only in one area.  I really like that they have snack machines and snack bars with edible stuff that make waiting long periods of time a little more tolerable.  

I have ONE really big suggestion and I really hope someone is reading.  During a visit I noticed an elderly man sitting on a wheelchair trying to stand up to go to the bathroom. He had a very hard time doing so and his wife couldn&#039;t really help him. He tried grasping at the wall but couldn&#039;t stand up.  I helped him stand but I&#039;m sure this man was not the first or the last to experience this inconvenience at a hospital meant to cater people like himself. Put railings along the walls. Might not sound like a big deal but watching this man struggle was a pretty big deal.&lt;/div&gt;]]></description>

They get their part timers from sf parnassus which is a state of the art training facility. 

i&#039;ve had good and bad experiences over the past 10 years at fort. milley. i&#039;ve been to urgent care numerous times, the ER numerous times, i&#039;ve even seen psych evaluation 51/50 check in up close and personal. 

i&#039;ve done overnight testing, a week long EEG in-take monitoring and been through countless anger management, stress management, dcoping skills groups. i&#039;ve had psychologist fellow after fellow for 8 years, ptsd groups, occupational therapy, physical therapy and many primary care doctor visits.

I haven&#039;t felt an urge to murder anybody at this facility and that itself is a telling marker in itself. Building 8 is the mental herb spot and this is the building in which I spent most of my time, it felt like home after awhile. 

My medication doctor, dr. Wolfe was and is by far the best there is concerning medication giver folk. I miss him dearly, my children liked him very much and they would come to my psyc appointments with me just absolutely thrilled to see dr. Wolfe.

The parking lot is also good for a laugh or a quick pick me up...I used to enjoy reading the bumper stickers, I.e. The footprint of the American chicken and the symbol being the peace symbol ands u more idiotic slogans and pat on the back ego stroking words strung together.

If you have gone to war and have come home with mental and emotional problems, you should go here, it&#039;s good for said problems.&lt;/div&gt;]]></description>

<div class="description">fort milley, the SFVA, is the most funded VA in the country from my understanding, they do have far more progressive like programs than other VA&#8217;s. They get their part timers from sf parnassus which is a state of the art training facility. </p>
<p>i&#8217;ve had good and bad experiences over the past 10 years at fort. milley. i&#8217;ve been to urgent care numerous times, the ER numerous times, i&#8217;ve even seen psych evaluation 51/50 check in up close and personal. </p>
<p>i&#8217;ve done overnight testing, a week long EEG in-take monitoring and been through countless anger management, stress management, dcoping skills groups. i&#8217;ve had psychologist fellow after fellow for 8 years, ptsd groups, occupational therapy, physical therapy and many primary care doctor visits.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t felt an urge to murder anybody at this facility and that itself is a telling marker in itself. Building 8 is the mental herb spot and this is the building in which I spent most of my time, it felt like home after awhile. </p>
<p>My medication doctor, dr. Wolfe was and is by far the best there is concerning medication giver folk. I miss him dearly, my children liked him very much and they would come to my psyc appointments with me just absolutely thrilled to see dr. Wolfe.</p>
<p>The parking lot is also good for a laugh or a quick pick me up&#8230;I used to enjoy reading the bumper stickers, I.e. The footprint of the American chicken and the symbol being the peace symbol ands u more idiotic slogans and pat on the back ego stroking words strung together.</p>
<p>If you have gone to war and have come home with mental and emotional problems, you should go here, it&#8217;s good for said problems.</p></div>

The staff is caring. They seem to care more about their patients, than many private clinics and hospitals do. They have all the latest technology. I think are Veterans are in good hands when they come here.&lt;/div&gt;]]></description>

There was something reassuring about the outline of San Francisco VA Medical Center in the picturesque distance. A prominent and symbolic building.

The San Francisco VA Medical Center is a pillar of comfort for so many veterans in San Francisco. It&#039;s a well maintained building that attempts to address the needs of those who are so intimately affected by the devastation of war. Whether it&#039;s through programs for those suffering from PTSD or physical injuries and much more - the San Francisco VA Medical Ceneter has some extensive research and hands-on programs in place to aid the welfare of veteran patients. From my understanding they are continually looking for ways to improve their programs and genuinely care about addressing the health of veterans as a whole - both physically and mentally.

I have known people who have worked at this facility and those that were patients there. Both were very passionate about the staff and the resources available here. Both expressed to me how blessed we are to have such a well funded and evolving space like the VA Medical Center here in San Francisco

Trust.&lt;/div&gt;]]></description>

<div class="description">I used to climb up on Moraga hill and survey the mist laced landscape.</p>
<p>There was something reassuring about the outline of San Francisco VA Medical Center in the picturesque distance. A prominent and symbolic building.</p>
<p>The San Francisco VA Medical Center is a pillar of comfort for so many veterans in San Francisco. It&#8217;s a well maintained building that attempts to address the needs of those who are so intimately affected by the devastation of war. Whether it&#8217;s through programs for those suffering from PTSD or physical injuries and much more &#8211; the San Francisco VA Medical Ceneter has some extensive research and hands-on programs in place to aid the welfare of veteran patients. From my understanding they are continually looking for ways to improve their programs and genuinely care about addressing the health of veterans as a whole &#8211; both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>I have known people who have worked at this facility and those that were patients there. Both were very passionate about the staff and the resources available here. Both expressed to me how blessed we are to have such a well funded and evolving space like the VA Medical Center here in San Francisco</p>
<p>Trust.</p></div>
