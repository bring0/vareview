				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">About the Wm. Jennings Bryan Dorn VAMC</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.columbiasc.va.gov/locations/directions.asp">Driving Directors and Campus Map</a></p>
<p>Welcome! Thank you for visiting the William Jennings Bryan Dorn VA Medical Center website. This site is a part of our commitment to make your experience with our Medical Center as personal and as individual as we can!</p>
<p>Please consider this site as an extension of our relationship with you as a member of our community, a Veteran, a patient, or family member of one of our patients. The content has been organized so that you can easily find the information you need, and we have made it easy to reach us should you need more assistance.</p>
<p>If you are a Veteran, please take a few minutes to set up your own profile in <a href="https://www.myhealth.va.gov/index.html">My HealtheVet</a>. At My HealtheVet, you can read more about what interests you, as well as manage your prescriptions, appointments, and other medical information.</p>
<p>The William Jennings Bryan Dorn VA Medical Center (VAMC) opened in 1932 at its current location. Dorn VAMC has 204 skilled nursing beds, which includes acute medical, surgical, psychiatric, and long-term care. The hospital provides primary, secondary, and some tertiary care. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2013, Dorn VAMC gained 2.8 percent in enrolled patients. In FY 2013, there were a total of 75,813 unique patients including 6,381 female Veterans and 15,829 Veterans from the OIF/OEF/OND period of service. In FY 13, there were 936,424 outpatient visits and 5,005 inpatients treated.</p>
<p>The Dorn VAMC provides outpatient care through seven Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) located in South Carolina in the Upstate, Midlands and Pee Dee areas of South Carolina. The seven CBOCs are located in Anderson, Florence, Greenville, Rock Hill, Orangeburg, Spartanburg and Sumter. All clinics with the exception of Rock Hill are VA employee staffed. The Rock Hill CBOC opened on July 2, 2012, and we opened a new Greenville VA Outpatient Clinic in August 2013. All clinics have a mental health component available.</p>
<p>Dorn VAMC is a level 1C teaching hospital, providing a full range of patient care services, with state-of-the-art technology, education, and research. Comprehensive health care is provided through primary care, tertiary care and long-term care in areas of medicine, surgery, psychiatry, physical medicine and rehabilitation, cardiology, neurology, oncology, dentistry, geriatrics and extended care.</p>
<p>Dorn VAMC was accredited by The Joint Commission as recent as February 2013. It was only 1 of 20 hospitals in South Carolina and, for the third year in a row, a Top Performer on Key Quality Measures. Dorn VA is also accredited by the American College of Surgeons and the Commission on Accreditation for Rehabilitation Facilities. Laboratory and Pathology services are accredited by the Commission on Laboratory Accreditation of the College of American Pathologists.</p>
<p>Veterans Benefits Administration and the University of South Carolina School Of Medicine are located on the campus of Dorn VAMC. There are 48 residency positions between the two institutions. Other affiliations are robust for training of nurses and allied health professions. Similarly, medical center leadership has active relationships with the Department of Defense (DoD), both with Fort Jackson and Shaw Air Force Base.</p>
