				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System (SLVHCS) provides quality, compassionate, safe health care to Veteran patients throughout 23 parishes in southeast Louisiana. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the New Orleans VAMC was devastated. SLVHCS reorganized to meet the needs of Veterans and now consists of eight community-based clinics located in New Orleans, Slidell, Hammond, St. John Parish, Houma, Franklin, Bogalusa and Baton Rouge. Ninety percent of patients live within 30 minutes of primary and mental health services. Specialty care is available through the New Orleans and Baton Rouge clinics and inpatient services are coordinated through community facilities and other Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. Programs are available for special needs populations including those with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and spinal cord injury.</p>
<p>SLVHCS has also expanded programs to provide additional home-based community services. Home Based Primary Care, Respite Care, and Community Adult Day Care are just a few examples.  SLVHCS is also one of only two national<a title="Link to Hospital at Home Program" href="http://www.neworleans.va.gov/Hospital_at_Home.asp">Hospital at Home Program</a> sites, providing care to Veteran patients in their homes, shortening hospital stays and increasing patient comfort.  To date, Hospital at Home admitted over 300 patients with a variety of conditions and offered them doctor-directed, nurse-provided care.  Another option SLVHCS uses to expand care availability is the Care Coordination Tele-health Program, which allows Veterans to transmit vital signs such blood pressure and diabetic sugar levels from the comfort of their home to on-call nurses, reducing the need to come to a clinic for services.</p>
<p>Mental Health Services now include specialized Mental Health Programs such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Homeless Services, Substance Abuse Treatment, home-based management of chronic mental illnesses (Mental Health Intensive Case Management, MHICM) and a compensated work therapy program. Specialized mental health programs are now available in New Orleans 3426, 3434 and 3500 Canal Street.</p>
<p>The Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) program has greatly expanded, with enrollment increasing nearly eightfold since Hurricane Katrina. In Fiscal Year 2010, over 4900 OEF/OIF/OND Veterans were enrolled for care in SLVHCS, and outreach activities included Yellow Ribbon events, homecomings, deployment ceremonies and more.  Many Veterans of these wars are eligible for care up to five years after their discharge, and SLVHCS services will continue to grow to meet the need.</p>
<p>Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System’s (SLVHCS) Ambulatory Procedure Unit (APU) at 2237 Poydras Street in New Orleans opened in May 2011.  The APU enables SLVHCS physicians to locally perform same-day surgeries and medical procedures such as colonoscopies, hernia repairs, biopsies and cataract removal.</p>
<p>The 2237 Poydras Street location also houses several non-APU services such as the pain, gastrointestinal (GI) and audiology clinics.  Patients may park in the parking garage at 1601 Perdido Street and take a shuttle to the APU location.</p>
<p>Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System (SLVHCS) opened a new, expanded Vision Center in New Orleans in December 2010. The new space, located at 1515 Poydras Street, suite 650, is larger and accommodates several new exam rooms. This allows SLVHCS providers to offer more appointments each day.  The new clinic has a spacious waiting area, separate dilation waiting area and expanded exam rooms.</p>
<p>Because the Vision Center is located across and down the street from the rest of the specialty care facilities, SLVHCS offers shuttle service to the clinic every 30 minutes. Shuttles depart from 1601 Perdido Street, in front of the old hospital.</p>
<p>For those interested in walking to the clinic, 1515 Poydras Street is across the street from the VA parking garage, one block closer to City Hall. The main entrance is on Poydras Street, and the clinic is located on the sixth floor. A handicapped-accesible entrance is located on LaSalle Street.</p>
