				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recently relocated outpatient clinic in Newport, VT is White River Junction VA Medical Center&#8217;s northernmost facility for rural Vermont Veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs is committed to increasing access to VA healthcare for its rural Veterans by providing new outpatient facilities in areas where Veterans currently travel long distances for their care. The clinic is staffed by VA personnel. The VA Newport Outpatient clinic first opened its doors to northern Vermont Veterans on the 12th of August, 2010 at the North Country Hospital location. The 1734 Crawford Farm Road clinic space serves the primary health care needs of eligible veterans in the Newport, Vermont area, while mental health services will continue to be available at Northeast Kingdom Human Services on 154 Duchess Avenue in Newport.</p>
