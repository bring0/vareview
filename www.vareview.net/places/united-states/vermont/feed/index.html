				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recently relocated outpatient clinic in Newport, VT is White River Junction VA Medical Center&#8217;s northernmost facility for rural Vermont Veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs is committed to increasing access to VA healthcare for its rural Veterans by providing new outpatient facilities in areas where Veterans currently travel long distances for their care. The clinic is staffed by VA personnel. The VA Newport Outpatient clinic first opened its doors to northern Vermont Veterans on the 12th of August, 2010 at the North Country Hospital location. The 1734 Crawford Farm Road clinic space serves the primary health care needs of eligible veterans in the Newport, Vermont area, while mental health services will continue to be available at Northeast Kingdom Human Services on 154 Duchess Avenue in Newport.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White River Junction VA Medical Center (WRJ VAMC) is responsible for the delivery of health care services to eligible Veterans in Vermont and the 4 contiguous counties of New Hampshire. These services are delivered at the Medical Center&#8217;s main campus located in White River Junction, Vermont, and at its seven Outpatient Clinics (Bennington, Brattleboro, Burlington, Newport, and Rutland, Vermont; Keene and Littleton, New Hampshire). The White River Junction VA is closely affiliated with the Geisel School of Medicine (formerly Dartmouth Medical School), the University of Vermont College of Medical, with multiple other nursing and allied health affiliations.</p>
<p>The White River Junction (WRJ) VA Medical Center is located on a 64 acre hillside setting in the Upper Connecticut River Valley. The Medical Center includes a hospital building, a 47,000 square foot research building, an ambulatory care building, and buildings for clinical and administrative support. The hospital&#8217;s bi-state catchment area includes approximately 73,000 veterans (48,500 in Vermont and 24,500 in New Hampshire).</p>
<p>The Medical Center is a 74-bed, acute care facility that provides a full range of primary, secondary, and specialty care. Clinical services focus on a comprehensive, compassionate continuum of care. Inpatient beds include:</p>
<ul>
<li>43 medical/surgical beds</li>
<li>7 ICU beds (medical and surgical)</li>
<li>10 psychiatry beds</li>
<li>14 Residential Recover Center beds (a Substance Abuse Residential Rehab Treatment Program)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, four state-of-the-art Operating Room Suites, and six Post Anesthesia Recovery beds support WRJ&#8217;s active surgery program.</p>
