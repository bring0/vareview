				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since April 1922, the Sheridan VAMC has been a mental health care and primary care facility for men and women who have served their country.  In 1898 the grounds that are now the Sheridan VAMC were set aside by President William McKinley to be a military fort.  The fort was named after Brigadier General Ranald Slidell Mackenzie.  The first troops to the fort in 1901 were Buffalo Soldiers who used the fort for rest and retraining.  By World War I, the fort was closed and ready for demolition.  However, former President Taft, who after leaving office was appointed to the Supreme Court, was able to get the fort transferred to the Bureau of Health as a hospital for men coming home from WWI with battle fatigue or what is known today as PTSD.  The hospital opened in April 1922 as a 300 bed facility.  By the end of World War II, the facility had 900 beds.</p>
<p>Today the Sheridan VAMC has 208 beds and serves nearly 12,500 Veterans yearly.   The Medical Center boast eight Community Based Outpatient Clinics, located strategically across Wyoming.  Each clinic, along with the Medical Center, is staffed to provide a wide range of health and mental health services.</p>
