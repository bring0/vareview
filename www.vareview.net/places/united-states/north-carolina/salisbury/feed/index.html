<p>Since 1953, Hefner VAMC has been improving the health of the men and women who have so proudly served our nation. We consider it our privilege to serve your health care needs in any way we can. Primary and secondary inpatient health care are available to more than 287,000 veterans living in a 24-county area of the Central Piedmont Region of North Carolina. This includes the Charlotte area with over 100,000 veterans, and the Winston-Salem area with 65,000 veterans.</p>
<p>Inpatient services include acute medicine, cardiology, surgery, psychiatry and physical medicine and rehabilitation, as well as sub-acute and extended care. Primary and specialized outpatient services are provided at the medical center complex and the community based outpatient clinics. Services are also provided at the Veterans Outreach Centers Centers in Greensboro and Charlotte. Contractual extended care is provided through an extensive residential care treatment program and a community nursing home program.</p>

<ul>
