				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The VA Dialysis Clinic at Brier Creek is a 6,300 square foot facility that provides outpatient hemodialysis services for Veterans in and around the Raleigh area. The clinic has 12 dialysis treatment stations. On average, each dialysis patient requires 3-4 hour treatments, three times a week. The center operates two shifts, six days a week, allowing 48 Veterans to receive life saving treatment each week. North Carolina is in an area considered part of the Kidney Disease Belt, a region that experiences a higher rate of kidney disease than any other part of the country. The Veterans in the VA Mid-Atlantic Care Network have the highest rate of kidney disease in the county. In light of this, the VA Dialysis Clinic at Brier Creek is a valuable addition to the community that helps increase access to high quality health care for area Veterans. Hemodialysis removes wastes and water from the blood of patients suffering from kidney failure. There are more than 35 Veterans receiving dialysis treatments at the Durham VA Medical Center and more than 200 Veterans receiving dialysis at non-VA community dialysis providers. The VA Dialysis Clinic at Brier Creek is one of four freestanding dialysis clinics opening around the country this year. The others are in Fayetteville, N.C., Cleveland, Ohio, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. For questions about the VA Dialysis Clinic at Brier Creek or the availability of dialysis services, please contact LaTashia Williams, Nurse Manager, at (919) 286-5220.
