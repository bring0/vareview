				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Fayetteville VA Medical Center&#8217;s Brunswick County Outreach Clinic is a 2,000 square foot facility located at Supply, N.C. that provides primary care health services for Veterans in and around Brunswick County.</p>
<p>The Brunswick County Outreach Clinic will offer primary care services Monday through Thursday, with a rotating schedule of specialty care and health educational classes on Fridays.  Veterans currently enrolled in the VA health system and assigned to other clinics will be given the opportunity to transfer their care to the Brunswick County Outreach Clinic.</p>
<p>Providers at the Brunswick County Outreach Clinic operate under the PACT – Patient Aligned Care Team – system.  Each team consists of a medical provider (doctor, nurse practitioner or physician assistant), registered nurse, licensed practical nurse and a medical administration specialist.  Each team is responsible for approximately 1,200 patients and each will work closely with each Veteran to provide more personalized care.  The PACT system will allow Veterans better access to care as each person on the team will be more familiar with the patient&#8217;s needs and there will be more walk-in appointment slots available.</p>
<p>For information on health benefits eligibility, please call (910) 822-7016 and press 6 when prompted.</p>
