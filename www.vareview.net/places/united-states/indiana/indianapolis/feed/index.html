				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="page-title">About the Richard L. Roudebush VAMC, Indianapolis, Indiana</h2>
<p>The Richard L. Roudebush Indianapolis VA Medical Center, located 2 miles northwest of the heart of downtown Indianapolis, has been serving Indiana Veterans since 1932.  As Indiana’s tertiary care facility, Indianapolis VA Medical Center receives referrals from VA facilities at Ft. Wayne and Marion, Indiana, and from nearby Danville, Illinois.</p>
<p>Indianapolis VA Medical Center provides acute inpatient medical, surgical, psychiatric, neurological, and rehabilitation care, as well as both primary and specialized outpatient services. Some noteworthy specialized services include comprehensive cardiac care, radiation oncology treatment and community based extended care.</p>
<p>Indianapolis VA Medical Center is aggressively using emerging technology in the tele-home care and tele-disease management arenas. The medical center was selected as the site for the Veterans in Partnership (VISN 11) Network Polytrauma Center and is providing ongoing support to the returning Veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND). Additionally, the medical center has a 50-bed Domiciliary Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program targeting homeless Veterans.</p>
<p>The medical center operates three <a href="http://www.indianapolis.va.gov/locations/index.asp" target="_blank">Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC’s)</a> located in Bloomington, Martinsville, and Terre Haute, Indiana.  The more than 60,000 patients (3,700 women Veterans) treated by the Indianapolis VA Medical Center require over 613,000 outpatient visits and almost 7,900 inpatient episodes of care yearly.</p>
<p>The Indianapolis VA Medical Center has reorganized and changed the approach to quality improvement, implementing Lean Six Sigma™  concepts to encourage system redesign and process improvement, establishing a system of assigned accountability for all performance measures and training Rapid Cycle Change Coaches to facilitate performance improvement. The medical center received a grant to improve system redesign capability. It is also actively involved with the <a href="http://www.indianapolis.va.gov/VERC/index.asp" target="_blank">VISN 11 Veterans Engineering Resource Center</a>.</p>
<p>The medical center is embarking on the next phase of lean health care, modeled after the successful Theda Care ™ organization. Focus is on continuous daily improvement at the unit level and is part of Indy Excellence 2.0, the next generation of the successful organizational culture initiative. Additionally, the medical center continues to contribute to the city-wide Patient Safety Coalition, implementing standard practices city-wide to increase patient safety.</p>
