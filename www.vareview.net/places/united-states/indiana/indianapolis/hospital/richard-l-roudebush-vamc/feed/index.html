I have had several inpatient stays here and was well taken care of. The nurses were overworked but still kept a smile on their faces and were very nice. My care was above average.

I also have been kicked out of the ER on a holiday, but I was subsequently admitted at another hospital afterwards. This was very upsetting as the VA had previously admitted me for the same condition multiple times in the recent past. 

I have had to use Patient Advocacy twice to resolve some issues, but overall I can accept the care that Roudebush provides me.

The hospital itself is pretty modern and a recent increase in available parking has helped a lot! The staff have been mostly awesome, dedicated professionals, but you can tell that these folks put in a lot of hours!

I have not been to any other VAMC so I cannot compare, but Roudebush is more than acceptable for my current needs. I just wish the VA wouldn&#039;t force us vet&#039;s to refill meds via mail. I hate not knowing month to month if I&#039;m going to get my meds on time!!&lt;/div&gt;]]></description>
