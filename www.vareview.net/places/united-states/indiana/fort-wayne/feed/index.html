				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>VANIHCS was formed in 1995 by the integration of the VA Medical Centers in Fort Wayne and Marion, Indiana.  The Fort Wayne Campus offers primary and secondary medical and surgical services, and the Marion Campus offers a full range of mental health, nursing home care, and extended care services.  Primary care clinics are available at both medical center campuses and at Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) located in South Bend, Goshen, Peru and Muncie Indiana.  Recently completed renovations and construction, and continuous maintenance, ensure an attractive, state-of-the-art healthcare environment.</p>
