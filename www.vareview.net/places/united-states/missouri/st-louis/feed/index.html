				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are pleased that you have chosen the VA St. Louis Health Care System for your care and have taken this opportunity to visit our web site. Please consider this site an extension of our relationship with you as a member of our community, a veteran, a patient, or family member of one of our patients.</p>
<p>Our mission is to honor America’s veterans by providing exceptional health care that improves their health and well-being.</p>
<h2>VA St. Louis Health Care System</h2>
<p>The VA St. Louis Health Care System provides inpatient and ambulatory care in medicine, surgery, psychiatry, neurology, and rehabilitation, and many other subspecialty areas. It is a two-division facility that serves veterans and their families in east central Missouri and southwestern Illinois.</p>
<p>The John Cochran Division, named after the late Missouri congressman, is located in midtown St. Louis and has all of the medical center&#8217;s operative surgical capabilities, the ambulatory care unit, intensive care units, outpatient psychiatry clinics, and expanded laboratory.</p>
<p>The Jefferson Barracks Division is a multi-building complex overlooking the Mississippi River in south St. Louis County. It provides psychiatric treatment, spinal cord injury treatment, a nursing home care unit, geriatric health care, rehabilitation services, and a rehabilitation domiciliary program for homeless veterans.</p>
<p>The John Cochran and Jefferson Barracks Division are undergoing major construction projects that will enable us to better serve your health care needs.</p>

<h2>Values</h2>
<p>VA embraces five &#8220;Core Values&#8221; for all of our employees. We need values in place as the &#8220;backbone&#8221; for our health care system. These five core values (I.C.A.R.E.) are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integrity</strong>: Act with high moral principle. Adhere to the highest professional standards. Maintain the trust and confidence of all with whom I engage.</li>
<li><strong>Commitment</strong>: Work diligently to serve Veterans and other beneficiaries. Be driven by an earnest belief in VA’s mission. Fulfill my individual responsibilities and organizational responsibilities.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy</strong>: Be truly Veteran-centric by identifying, fully considering, and appropriately advancing the interests of Veterans and other beneficiaries.</li>
<li><strong>Respect</strong>: Treat all those I serve and with whom I work with dignity and respect. Show respect to earn it.</li>
<li><strong>Excellence</strong>: Strive for the highest quality and continuous improvement. Be thoughtful and decisive in leadership, accountable for my actions, willing to admit mistakes, and rigorous in correcting them.</li>
</ul>
