				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System (CAVHS), a flagship Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare provider, is one of the largest and busiest VA medical centers in the country. Its two hospitals, located in Little Rock and North Little Rock, anchor a broad spectrum of inpatient and outpatient healthcare services, ranging from disease prevention through primary care, to complex surgical procedures, to extended rehabilitative care. This System serves as a teaching facility for more than 1,500 students and residents enrolled in more than 65 educational programs; its principal affiliate is the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.</p>
<p>CAVHS is reaching out to veterans through its community-based outpatient clinics in Mountain Home, El Dorado, Hot Springs, Mena, Pine Bluff, Searcy, Conway, Russellville, its Home Health Care Service Center in Hot Springs, and a VA Drop-In Day Treatment Center for homeless veterans in downtown Little Rock. Throughout its richÂ 90 year history, CAVHS has been widely recognized for excellence in education, research, and emergency prepardedness, and -first and foremost -for a tradition of quality and caring for Arkansas veterans.</p>
