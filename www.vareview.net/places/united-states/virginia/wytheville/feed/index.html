				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Wytheville CBOC is located on 165 Peppers Ferry Road. VA staff at this new site of care provide outpatient primary care and general mental health services. Management and staffing of the Wytheville CBOC are the responsibility of the Salem VAMC. This clinic provides primary care and general mental health services to Veterans from Bland, Carroll, Giles, Grayson, Pulaski, Smythe and Wythe counties in Virginia and Mercer county in West Virginia. VA estimates that about 13,500 Veterans reside in this service area. It is estimated about 3,500 Veterans may seek care at the Wytheville Clinic.</p>
<p>Veterans currently enrolled in the Salem or Beckley VA Medical Centers who are in close proximity to the Wytheville clinic will be given an option to enroll for their care at the new clinic site. Veterans can enroll for care at the Wytheville CBOC; or they may contact the Salem VAMC or Beckley VAMC for enrollment information.</p>
<p><strong>Directions:</p>
<p></strong><u>Coming from Bristol</u>, take I 81 N to exit 70, take a right at the stop sign and drive down to the 4th light and turn left—it is a left turn only lane, and the road is Monroe Street. Drive thru the 5th light which takes you onto Peppers Ferry Rd, get in right lane and turn right into the Veteran’s Administration directly behind Rite Aid, and across from Derm One.</p>
<p><u>Coming from I 77 N</u>, take I 77 S to exit 41, when you get to the top of the hill, turn right. Go past the hotels, go under the bridge, you will pass the cemetery on the left and when you see the stop light get in the left lane as we are on the left right after the cemetery, before the Rite Aid. Do not go thru the light, you have gone too far.</p>
<p><u>Coming from I 77 S or I 81 N</u>, get off on exit 72—I 77 N, stay in right lane as you will be taking the very first exit, exit 41 on the right. When you get to the top of the hill, turn right, go back over I 77 N, pass the gas stations, pass the hotels, go under the bridge, you will see a cemetery on the right, when you see the cemetery on the left, get in the left lane as you will turn left. Our building is on the left before you get to the light.</p>
