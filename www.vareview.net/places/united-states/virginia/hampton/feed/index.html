<p>Located along the historic banks of the Chesapeake Bay, the Hampton VA Medical Center (VAMC) is a world class facility with highly skilled and compassionate staff.  The medical center is a leader in technology and innovation providing health care services to Veterans in southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina.  The Hampton VAMC is a tertiary care, Complexity Level 2 hospital.  Hampton VAMC provides comprehensive primary and specialty care in medicine, surgery, and psychiatry. The Medical Center is geographically positioned among one of the largest DoD active duty and military retiree populations in the United States.  As a result, the Medical Center has seen a 7% increase among Veterans seeking VA care.  The Hampton VAMC recently opened a state-of-the-art Women’s Clinic designed to provide gender specific care under one roof.  Additional expansions at the medical center include the Spinal Cord Injury Unit and Mental Health Unit.  Rich with history, the medical center is proud to be the health care provider of choice for Hampton Roads Veterans.</p>
