				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">About the Northern Arizona VA Health Care System</h2>
<p>The Northern Arizona VA Healthcare System (NAVAHCS) is a Joint Commission-accredited, complexity level three facility serving 26,000 Veterans across Northern Arizona.  NAVAHCS provides a continuum of primary and secondary level medical, rehabilitative and long-term care to Veterans residing in northern and central Arizona. Acute medical care consists of primary and secondary inpatient medicine and ambulatory care, which includes general medicine, ambulatory procedures, and selected specialized medical clinics. The Emergency Department is open 24 hours/7 days a week. The VA Medical Center is located in Prescott, Arizona and Community Based Outpatient Clinics are located in Anthem, Flagstaff, Cottonwood, Kingman and Lake Havasu City, AZ.  NAVAHCS has four Outreach (Telehealth) Clinics; Holbrook, Page, Tuba City and Polacca, AZ, along with a Primary Care Outreach Clinic in the Indian Health Service Health Care Center located in Chinle, AZ and a mobile clinic located in Chinle, AZ serving outlying Navajo Veterans at Pinon and Kayenta, AZ.  NAVAHCS catchment area cover over 60,000 square miles.<br />

<p><b><strong>21 Bed Acute Care Unit</strong></b></p>
<p>The Medicine inpatient wards are comprised of a fifteen bed medical unit, all with private rooms, and a separate six bed Med/telemetry unit. Our Medicine units provide patient centered care, focused on the whole person and their specific healthcare needs and to transition to home successfully.  All patients have access to physical medicine and rehabilitation, dietary consultation, social and mental health services as well as self-care education. The medicine unit provides care to adult Veterans with a variety of general medical needs (IV therapy, wound care, chronic pain, monitoring of dysrhythmias) and education regarding their illness.</p>
<p><b><strong>120 Bed Domiciliary<br />
</strong></b>The Domiciliary is a <b><strong>Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program (MH RRTP) </strong></b>for Veterans who have mental health, substance use, and vocational recovery goals that can be addressed during a short-term stay. Routine medical care is available. The program is to enhance independence, foster self-sufficiency, and aid in recovery. Treatment program activities are geared toward bio psychosocial rehabilitation, physical well-being, socio-economic stabilization, vocational enhancement, and leisure planning.</p>
