				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="page-title">About the Minneapolis VA Health Care System</h2>
<p>Minneapolis VA Health Care System (VAHCS) is a teaching hospital providing a full range of patient care services with state-of-the-art technology, as well as education and research. Comprehensive health care is provided through primary care, tertiary care and long-term care in areas of medicine, surgery, psychiatry, physical medicine and rehabilitation, neurology, oncology, dentistry, geriatrics and extended care.</p>
<h3>Patient Care</h3>
<p>Minneapolis VA Health Care System is redesigning VA healthcare delivery through Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT). This initiative increases access, coordination, communication and continuity of care. PACT provides accessible, coordinated, comprehensive, patient-centered care and is managed by primary care providers with the active involvement of other clinical and nonclinical staff. PACT allows patients to have a more active role in their health care and is associated with increased quality improvement, patient satisfaction, and a decrease in hospital costs due to fewer hospital visits and readmissions.</p>
<p>Our hospital, long-term care, behavioral health and home-care programs are accredited by <a title="The Joint Commission (TJC)" href="http://www.jointcommission.org/" target="_blank">The Joint Commission (TJC)</a>. In addition, our rehabilitation programs are accredited by the <a title="Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF)" href="http://www.carf.org/home/" target="_blank">Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF)</a>. Our laboratory and pathology services are recognized by the <a title="College of American Pathologists (CAP)" href="http://www.cap.org/apps/cap.portal" target="_blank">College of American Pathologists (CAP)</a>. We are also accredited by the <a title="American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer" href="http://www.facs.org/cancer/" target="_blank">American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer</a>.</p>
<p>The Minneapolis VAHCS is designated as one of four <a title="Polytrauma VA Medical Centers" href="http://www.polytrauma.va.gov/facilities/Minneapolis.asp" target="_blank">Polytrauma VA Medical Centers</a>. As such, the medical center receives active-duty service members and Veterans for rehabilitation of injuries such as traumatic brain injury, blindness and amputation. A 10-bed transitional and community re-entry unit for polytrauma patients provides continued rehabilitation therapies to assist Veterans and active-duty service members to reach their highest level of independence in the community. They will learn to apply their rehabilitation skills in community settings in preparation to transition into their home communities.</p>
<p>In 2009, a $20 million <a title="Spinal Cord Injury/Disorder (SCI/D) Center" href="http://www.minneapolis.va.gov/services/scidc/scidc_welcome.asp">Spinal Cord Injury/Disorder (SCI/D) Center</a> was opened. The 65,000-square-foot center provides acute rehabilitation, primary care and sustaining care for Veterans with spinal cord injuries and disorders. The facility includes a 30-bed inpatient unit , outpatient clinics, therapies and offices. A dedicated special-procedure room provides urodynamics as well as other specialized testing. The center is part of a national VA network of SCI/D centers.</p>
